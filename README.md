## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── public
    ├── scripts
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── .stylelintrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/content`**: This directory contains all of the textual content of the site. There are sub-directories for awards, blog posts, and books.

2.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3.  **`/public`**: This directory will only exist after you have built your site with gatsby (via the `yarn build` command). It contains the gatsby-generated code for your website. Nothing in this folder should ever be directly modified by you.

4.  **`/scripts`**: This directory contains some scripts useful as development aids. Just ignore it. 😉

5.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

6.  **`/static`**: This directory contains “static” files that will be copied as-is to the previously mentioned `/public` folder when your site is built.

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

8.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

9.  **`.stylelintrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/). Stylelint is a tool to help avoid errors and adhere to conventions in your styles.

10. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

11. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

12. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

13. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

14. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

15. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

16. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project. The file you're reading right now. 😜

17. **`yarn.lock`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
