title: 'About Me'
---

I graduated from the [University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/) in May 2005 with a B.A. in Psychology. As I always had an interest in psychotherapy, I began looking into various clinical graduate programs shortly after graduation and enrolled the M.A. in Counseling Psychology program at [Santa Clara University](http://www.scu.edu/cp/) in 2006. My time at SCU was exceptionally rewarding, both professionally and personally, as it provided me with first-hand experience as to how psychological research can be applied to real-world situations and scenarios. However, it was clear to me early on that I was more interested in pursuing a research-based, rather than a clinical, career in psychology. My supervisor at the time had casually mentioned a recent influx of concern from her clients relating to the potential negative impact of video game use, particularly online video game use. At the time, the research in this area was scarce, which left clinicians with little information to disseminate to their clients. As an online gamer myself, the idea of perusing a PhD research project on this topic intrigued me and I soon began searching for a suitable research-based PhD program.

I was fortunate enough to secure a PhD researcher position at the [University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/) in York, England. Under the supervision of [Dr. Julian Oldmeadow](http://www.swinburne.edu.au/health-arts-design/staff-profiles/view.php?who=joldmeadow), my work aligned across two branches of inquiry: the cultural stereotype of online gamers and relationship between social (in)competence and online video game involvement. While the first highlighted the centrality of the negative social perceptions of online game players, the second examined the validity of this perception through an assessment of the relationship between video game involvement and social competence. My PhD research projects included survey-based and experimental research designs and led to several international conference presentations and publications in top peer-reviewed journals, such as [_Bulletin of Science, Technology, and Society_](http://bst.sagepub.com/) and [_Computers In Human Behavior_](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-in-human-behavior/). Recently, my PhD thesis was converted into a research monograph, entitled [_Video games and social competence_](http://www.tandf.net/books/details/9781138804265/), and published by [Routledge](http://www.routledge.com/) in December 2014.

I recently completed a 2-year post doctoral position working with [Prof. Dr. Thorsten Quandt](http://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/en/personen/thorsten-quandt.html) at the [University of Münster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany as an associate researcher for the large-scale, [ERC](http://erc.europa.eu/)-project “SOFOGA” (Social Foundations of Online Gaming). SOFOGA was a three-year project examining a range of game-related variables among a representative German sample and remains the largest EU-funded games research project to date. My work in this project focused on examining the potential inter- and intra-personal social impact of online video game involvement. This primarily involved enlisting cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches to survey-based and experimental research designs within large data sets. During my time at Münster, I gave numerous talks at international conferences on my work in this project as well as published several articles in top peer-reviewed journals such as [_Computers in Human Behavior_](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-in-human-behavior/) and [_Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking_](http://www.liebertpub.com/overview/cyberpsychology-behavior-brand-social-networking/10/). Through the course of my work on SOFOGA, I gained experience with a range of advanced quantitative data analysis techniques, including moderated and mediated regression analyses and cross-lagged path analysis via structural equation modeling.

I currently hold board positions within the [Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA)](http://www.digra.org/) and the [International Communication Association (ICA) Game Studies SIG](http://game.icahdq.org/ohana/website/index.cfm?p=56927916). Through my participation within these organizations over the last few years, I have spearheaded several projects aimed to improve the available resources for early career scholars, such as the creation of a student-centric special interest group of DiGRA ([Follow DiGRA Students on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/digrastudents)) and the re-development of [Ludodemia](http://rkowert.com/resources/ludodemia/), a database for games-related research.
