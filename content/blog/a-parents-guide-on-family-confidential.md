Have a tween or teen obsessed with video games? Find yourself in a constant battle over how much your kids spend on video games?

Earlier in the year, I spoke with Annie Fox about [A Parent's Guide to Video Games](https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Video-Games-understanding/dp/1537359835/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521417889&sr=1-1&keywords=a+parent%27s+guide+to+video+games) about kids' gaming, its effect on social and emotional development, and why we might not need to worry so much.
