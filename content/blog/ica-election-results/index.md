The votes are in! I am excited to report that my election for Secretary of Game Studies Special Interest Group (SIG) within the International Communication Association (ICA) has been successful! My term will start at the close of the Annual Conference in Seattle. I feel very privileged to be given the opportunity to hold a more active role within the Game Studies SIG and hope to serve the community well.

For those not familiar with [ICA](http://www.icahdq.org/), or the the [Game Studies SIG](game.icahdq.org), please follow the links in this post to learn more.
