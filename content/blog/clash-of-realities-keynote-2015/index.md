In 2015, I was invited to take part in the Clash of Realities conference hosted by the Cologne Game Lab at the University of Cologne ([see my previous post about the conference here](http://blog.rkowert.com/clash-of-realities-2015/)).  Unbeknownst to me (until recently), the second day of keynote lectures were recorded! I am pleased to be able to now share my keynote lecture: _Online Gaming Spaces as Socially Compensatory and Rehabilitative Spaces_. In this talk, I discuss the potential for online gaming spaces to be socially compensatory and rehabilitative spaces for socially vulnerable populations (e.g., shy, lonely, socially unskilled).  This lecture draws on empirical research that indicates the ability for online video games to be harnessed as socially rehabilitative spaces in the future.
