This week [Massively OP](http://massivelyop.com/) published an [op-ed on understanding video game research](http://massivelyop.com/2016/04/27/massively-ops-guide-to-understanding-video-game-research/). It does a really great job of outlining what is important to pay attention to when digesting this kind of research as well as what should potentially be questioned when interpreting the (negative) findings that we often seen strewn across the headlines. For anyone with an interest in video game research, I highly recommend checking it out!
