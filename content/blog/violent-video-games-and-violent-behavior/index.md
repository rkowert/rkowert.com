Moral panics relating to video games have been spiralling out of control for some time now. [_Grand Theft Auto_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)) causes school shootings, [_Leisure Suit Larry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry) leads to a decline in societies morals, [_Bully_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game)) teaches kids to be bullies by rewarding deviant behaviour – these sorts of claims have become so commonplace that game scholars (such as myself) have almost become immune to them. When I come across yet another claim that _GTA_ has inspired some heinous and deplorable act, all I can do is roll my eyes and wonder why newscasters are conducting such lazy reporting (I get similarly angry when they blame mental health without any supporting evidence – a good rant on that topic can be found [here](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/18/its_not_about_mental_illness_the_big_lie_that_always_follows_mass_shootings_by_white_males/)).

Today, I came across a transcript of a Fox News broadcast that, once again, was putting the blame on video games (Apparently this story is from February, 2014 but I had never come across it). This time, however, I couldn’t simply roll my eyes and move on to the next news story because it was far too ridiculous (you can see the story [here](http://www.p4rgaming.com/fox-news-confident-dark-souls-is-the-cause-of-most-school-shootings-and-racism-in-america/)).

The headline reads, “Fox News Confident Dark Souls is the Cause of Most School Shootings and Racism in America” – my interest was immediately peaked. What follows is a transcript of an interaction between several Fox News correspondents that begins with (at best) loose truths and ends with the absurd:

> __Hasselbeck__: _So tell us your thoughts on Dark Soul. Should the creators face the death penalty for making this game?_


No, I do not think the creators should face the death penalty for making this game. But I do think that news anchors should be required to know the facts before they start reporting to the masses. 

You could start with [this meta analysis](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11126-007-9056-9) of the influence of violent video games. If you want to take a broader approach, there is also [this meta analysis](http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(08)01037-8/abstract) of the general influence of media violence on aggressive behaviour. Or how about this [more recent article](http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1016-9040/a000147?journalCode=epp&) looking at the state of research on violence in digital games? Even those scholars who have [concluded that video game play is somehow related to negative outcomes](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/5/353.short) concede that the relationship is minimal and have not linked the use of video games to aggressive or violent behaviours but rather mild changes in attitudes.

 You could also take a different approach, and evaluate work that has looked at the effects of video games on outcomes other that violence – for instance [social outcomes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563213000927) or [sexism](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2014.0492). 

 __The conclusions are all the same: media has little to no impact on behavior. Age, gender, socio-economic status - all of these demographic factors are _far_ more influential.__

 _Update_: Turns out this article about a Fox news story was a hoax - sadly, it is [entirely believable as an actual story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) that would be aired on their network (for instance, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uic4YRhw1NA)). So, the rant shall remain...
