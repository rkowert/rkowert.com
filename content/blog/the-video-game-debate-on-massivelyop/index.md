Over the last few months, [_Massively Overpowered_](http://massivelyop.com/) (previously known as _Massively_) has been publishing a series of articles focusing on various chapters within my new book, [_The Video Game Debate..._](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638).  These articles do a great job of breaking down the main arguments that are put forth throughout the book and linking them with MMO play specifically. If you haven’t taken the plunge and purchased _The Video Game Debate..._ yet, but are interested in learning more about the topics discussed within it, these articles may be just the thing you are looking for!

You can check out the latest instalment – which happens to focus on my individual contribution to the book, social outcomes – [here[(http://massivelyop.com/2016/02/05/exploring-the-video-game-debate-social-outcomes-and-online-gamers/). Links are provided at the end of the article to the previous essays published about other chapters within the book.

If after reading the articles you find yourself thirsty for more, [_The Video Game Debate: Unravelling the physical, social, and psychological effects of digital games_ is available via Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638)*.
