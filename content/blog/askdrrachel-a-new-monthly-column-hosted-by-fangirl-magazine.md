I am proud to announce that I will be contributing a new monthly column to [Fangirl Magazine](http://www.fangirlthemag.com/) called [“Ask Dr. Rachel!”](http://www.fangirlthemag.com/2017/03/ask-dr-rachel-stereotypes-about-gamers-are-quick-to-form-and-slow-to-change/). In it, I will be fielding questions posed through social media about all things video games, and game studies, with a focus on media effects questions.

Have a question? Let me know! Send me an email (rkowert@gmail.com) or send your questions via Twitter (@linacaruso) using the hashtag #DrRachel.

The column for March is now up and you can [see it here](http://www.fangirlthemag.com/2017/03/ask-dr-rachel-stereotypes-about-gamers-are-quick-to-form-and-slow-to-change/).
