The International Games Summit on Mental Health Awareness (TIGS) was held last week over world mental health day in Toronto, Canada. This was the first annual meeting of the group and was hosted by Mark Chandler and Take This. Attendees included representatives from the games industry, such as game producers and managers, content creators, academics, clinicians, and game community managers. For two days we discussed the state of mental health in the games industry and ways in which it could be improved. Topics included crunch, burnout, online harassment, and the portrayal of mental health in gaming spaces.

It was incredible to have so many individuals from various corners of the games industry together in a single room to discuss the state of mental health in the industry. Everyone was engaged, the talks were incredibly productive, and we even got to demo a few new games, [Destinyâ€™s Sword](https://2dogsgames.com/) and Whittle.

I am looking forward to taking the talking points from our meeting and incorporating them in to some actionable items for change within the industry. The more we can have open discussions about these topics the more normalized they will become. I am incredibly proud to be part of the team that brought the first TIGS to life and look forward to seeing how things develop over the next year.
