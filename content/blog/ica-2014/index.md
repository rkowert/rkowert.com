This year’s annual meeting of the [International Communication Association](http://www.icahdq.org/) will be taking place in Seattle at the end of May. I am excited to announce that this year I will be presenting two research articles, one at the Game Studies pre-conference and one in the Game Studies’ SIG of the main conference. I will also be co-presenting an additional article in the Game Studies’ SIG that I co-authored with [Emese Domahidi](http://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/personen/emese-domahidi.html). All of these projects focus on the social and psychological causes and consequences of online video game involvement. The abstracts of these projects/presentations are outlined below:

__Psychosocial Causes and Consequences of Increased Online Video Game Engagement__ (Kowert, Vogelgesang, Festl, Quandt) – this paper is a loose replication of Lemmens et al. (2011) work looking at the links between psychosocial variables and video game involvement over time. Focusing on the role of online game play frequency and gamer self-identification, rather than problematic play, this study examined the relationships between social capital, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and online game play. After controlling for gender and age, four separate cross-lagged SEM models were estimated. Only one out of four models showed significant relationships and confirmed the hypothesized direction of effects: In addition to a positive cross-sectional correlation, the model indicates that identifying as an online gamer predicts life satisfaction over time. Apart from that, all cross sectional and cross-lagged effects of the other three SEM were non-significant. Second, using average online gaming frequency we re-estimated the four SEM to obtain effect sizes for the online gaming population only. Again, only one model out of four models showed a significant relationship: We obtained a negative cross-sectional correlation between life satisfaction and average online gaming frequency without the corresponding cross-lagged effect. With the exception of the relationship between life satisfaction and being an online gamer, the results largely disconfirm the research hypotheses and suggest that online video game play does not have a substantial negative impact on players’ psychosocial well-being over time.

__Examining the Relationship between Online Video Game Involvement and Gaming-Related Friendships among Emotionally Sensitive Individuals__ (Kowert & Domahidi) – this paper examines the extent to which online gaming spaces are contributing to tangible social benefits for the socially inhibited by evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a representative sample of German game players, the results indicate that emotionally sensitive (shy) players are using online gaming spaces differently than their less-shy counterparts and reporting tangible differences in their in-game friendship networks. This suggests that online games hold the potential to be socially advantageous for shy individuals by allowing them to overcome their traditional social difficulties and generate new friendships as well as strengthen old ones.

__Examining the Impact of Gaming-Related Friendships on Social Capital among Social Online Game Players__ (Domahidi & Kowert) – the aim of this paper is to examine the impact of different game-related friendships on players’ perceived social capital among social, online players. The results indicate that gaming-related social contacts have a significant impact on social capital outcomes. Engaging in online game play with pre-existing offline contacts was found to strengthen friendships, particularly in terms of instrumental support. Conversely, playing with online contacts was found to negatively impact instrumental support. Online gaming frequency was not found to significantly impact a player’s perceived social capital, indicating an absence of direct media effects.
