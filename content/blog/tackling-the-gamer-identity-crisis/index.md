What is a "gamer"? Who are "gamers"? How does one quantify the extent to which a person is or is not a "gamer"?

All of these questions have contributed to the recent "Gamer Identity Crisis". I dicuss these issues and the future of the "gamer" in a guest blog post for [VG Researcher](http://vgresearcher.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/tackling-the-gamer-identity-crisis/) (it can also be seen on [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/WaiYenTang/20140207/210298/Tackling_the_Gamer_Identity_Crisis.php)). 

This article was featured on [Game Career Guide](http://gamecareerguide.com/) (see [here](http://gamecareerguide.com/features/1289/tackling_the_gamer_identity_.php)) as well as re-posted on [First Person Scholar](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/) with an expanded conclusion (see [here](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/the-gamer-identity-crisis/)).
