The theme of this third session was “Violent Crime and Media Effects: Evidence and Speculation”. As we continue to look for answers for tragic mass crimes, discussion among researchers and the public about the potential role of violent media in serious violent crime is perhaps as active as it has ever been. <!--more-->This discussion included an examination of the research evidence linking violent media use to serious violent crime, trends and issues regarding the manner in which that research is conducted and interpreted, and the implications of that research for public safety and policy. This session’s special guests were [Christopher J. Ferguson](http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/) (Texas A&M International University) and [James D. Ivory](http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/index.html) (Virginia Tech). Other participants included [Rohangis Mohseni](https://plus.google.com/106024600216960559780/posts), [Johannes Breuer](https://plus.google.com/107771463837859243944/posts), [Rachel Kowert](http://rkowert.com), and [Malte Elson](https://plus.google.com/100780471969820578111/posts).
