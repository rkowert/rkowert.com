Concern about sexism, misogyny, and harassment in online games is of an ever growing concern among parents around the globe. This is perhaps because online games continue to grow in popularity among female players (in fact, a [2015 Pew Research study](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/device-ownership-2015-about-this-report/) found females are more likely to own gaming consoles than men).

I address these concerns and (do my best to) try to provide some insight and advice to parents grappling with these issues in my latest article for [_Fangirl Magazine_](http://www.fangirlthemag.com/). You can check out the article, [here](http://www.fangirlthemag.com/2017/02/what-parents-need-to-know-about-sexism-misogyny-and-harassment-in-online-games/).
