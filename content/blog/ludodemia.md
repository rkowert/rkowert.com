For those who are not familiar with [DiGRA Students](http://digrastudents.org/), we are an international community of students and early career researchers studying digital games. I, and my co-founder [Ashley O'Toole-Brown](http://amlbrown.com/), developed this community with the hopes that it would become a valuable resource for developments in the field, professional networking, and disseminating research. Together we have achieved many milestones in the last two years, including the establishment of an active [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/digrastudents), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/digrastudents), [Steam gaming community](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/digrastudents), and [online forums](http://discourse.digrastudents.org/). We have also developed a range of resources for the DiGRA Students community, including databases for [Games Research Journals](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-journals/), [Games Research Positions](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-positions/), and [Games Researchers on Twitter](http://digrastudents.org/games-research-twitter/). Our most recent addition is [Ludodemia](http://digrastudents.org/ludodemia/).

**WHAT IS LUDODEMIA?**

Ludodemia is a database for game studies research organized by topic. This database was [originally created by the Wellcome Trust](http://ludodemia.pbworks.com/w/page/67607594/Welcome%20to%20Ludodemia) as a resource for finding important articles related to particular categories within game studies. However, this resource was hidden in a corner of the Internet that was nearly impossible to find and the organization of the information within the database was difficult to navigate.

With the blessing of the Wellcome Trust, DiGRA Students took on the task of giving the Ludodemia data a [face lift](http://digrastudents.org/ludodemia/). Currently, the database holds the information for more than 950 sources and through crowd sourcing it continues to grow into a more comprehensive source for locating key research articles related to game studies. One of the new features of Ludodemia is the inclusion of [altmetric](http://www.altmetric.com/) data! This was included so users could instantly visualize a paper’s online attention. While it is not a direct measure of the quality of a particular article (altmetric data can only be generated for work with a doi or PubMed ID), it should help users to identity which papers that are the most popular and have been the most discussed within a particular topic.

**THIS IS AWESOME! BUT WHY ISN’T X OR Y INCLUDED IN THE DATABASE?**

The research that is currently stored in the database primarily derived from the information stored by the Wellcome trust. As such, you may find that some of key work (including your own work) is missing (this can include research articles / books / book chapters / conference proceedings). If you would like to make a request for something to be added to the database, please fill out [this form](http://digrastudents.org/ludodemia/request.html) with the related information. We will honor all requests that fit within the scope of Ludodemia and update the database regularly.

When using the request form you will notice that you must categorize your research into pre-existing category/sub-category options. The categories that are currently available were directly drawn from the existing Ludodemia hosted by the Wellcome trust. If you have suggestions as to how to improve these categories or requests for new categories please [join the discussion](http://discourse.digrastudents.org/t/ludodemia/201) on the DiGRA Student forums.

Also, if you feel that a particular piece of research is strongly related to more than one category, you may add it multiple times under different categories / subcategories. However, we ask that this is done only when the piece of work clearly crosses category boundaries.

We are beyond excited as to how this project has turned out and are excited to see how it will continue to grow and evolve in the future. We hope that Ludodemia will continue to become a popular resource for scholars across disciplines, but especially for those who are just entering the field of game studies (or are preparing their first lectures for a game studies courses)! Please feel free to share information about Ludodemia (as well as our other resources!) with your students and colleagues!
