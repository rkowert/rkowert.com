The first, "Seeking Social Comfort: The Social and Emotional Motivations Underlying Online Video Game Involvement" will be presented at the ICA preconference for the [Game Studies SIG](http://game.icahdq.org/ohana/website/?p=56927916) entitled <!--more-->["The Power of Play: Motivational Uses and Applications"](http://game.icahdq.org/ohana/website/?p=46901424). The second, "Video Game Involvement and Social Skills: A Systematic Review of the Literature" will be presented at the main conference.
