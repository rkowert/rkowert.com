This morning I had the pleasure of [talking about A Parent’s Guide to Video Games on my local NBC affiliate news station](http://kxan.com/2016/12/20/a-parents-guide-to-video-games-how-games-impact-children/). It is especially important to talk about video games this time of year, as many parents are scrambling to get their children’s favourite games and game consoles under the tree.

It may seem surprising to some that video games is still seen as a treacherous place for many parents despite the fact that they have been in our everyday lives for the last 30 to 40 years or so. However, turn on the news at any given hour and you will likely see way. Stories about in video games and violence or antisocial behavior or addiction, remain far too commonplace and it can be scary.

But you know science of game studies, and video game effects more specifically, is a really rich field of study that has been growing steadily for the last 10 years or so. Unfortunately, the amount of scientific findings in this area that has made it to the public is shockingly minimal, which is doing a great disservice to parents because it is providing a very narrow glimpse into the wealth of information we now have about what kinds of impact video games may be having on our well-being. This lack knowledge about game studies has really contributed to the maintenance of fear video games in our children’s everyday lives.

Hopefully I dispelled some of these fears today. In case you missed the interview (or are not a local Austinite), you [can watch a video of the interview here](http://kxan.com/2016/12/20/a-parents-guide-to-video-games-how-games-impact-children/).
