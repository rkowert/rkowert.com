In a few short weeks, I will be joining some of my favorite people at [PAX West](http://prime.paxsite.com/) in Seattle, WA. This time around, I will be participating in two different panels.

On Saturday, I will be part of the _The Psychology of The Legend of Zelda Franchise_ panel alongside Drs. [Anthony Bean](https://twitter.com/VideoGameDoc?lang=en), [Stephen Daniel](https://twitter.com/FusRoDoc?lang=en), and [Sarah Hays](https://twitter.com/XsarahdactylX?lang=en).

_Link is thrust into his destiny of having to defeat evil by collecting items and tools throughout Hyrule, proving himself a hero and eventually leading to a showdown with a villain. However, his journey is not just as simple as defeating evil and saving the princess. There are multiple and significant psychological concepts at play throughout different variations of this video game. This panel will Link the psychological concepts found in each game for discussion and questions from the audience._

On Sunday, I will be participating on the _WHO Said What?!: Let’s Talk Facts About Gaming Disorder_ panel with Drs. [Anthony Bean](https://twitter.com/VideoGameDoc?lang=en), [Jamie Madigan](https://twitter.com/JamieMadigan?lang=en), and [Raffael Boccamazzo](https://twitter.com/DoctorB_Seattle?lang=en).

_In June 2018 the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to include an official diagnosis for gaming addiction in their upcoming manual of diagnoses. The decision sent shockwaves throughout the world. What does this diagnosis mean, exactly? What counts as “addiction”? Why are people so keen on making it a diagnosis? Join Take This and our panel of mental health experts and researchers as we discuss this controversial diagnosis._

If you have any questions on either topic but won't be able to attend PAX West, you can send any of us a message ([including me](https://twitter.com/linacaruso?lang=en)) via Twitter (all Twitter handles are linked in this post).

Also, all of us will be around before and after the panels to chat and sign books - don't be shy, we are all very friendly and eager to chat!
