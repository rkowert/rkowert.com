I, alongside my co-chair [Ashley Brown](http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/disciplines/sociology/postgraduate/current/abrown/), am happy to announce the launch of the new [DiGRA students website](http://digrastudents.org/). This website was established in the hopes of fostering an international community of researchers studying digital games. We hope that this website will soon become a valuable resource for information and collaboration regarding all things related to DiGRA! While this site was built with students in mind (and the user base will primarily consist of students), it is not an exclusive club! Anyone can participate -- the more the merrier; the greater our community, the greater our resources!

The star of the show is the new and improved [discussion forums](http://discourse.digrastudents.org/)! The new software is very intuitive, making for a clean and organized format. Best of all, you can log in with your Facebook or Twitter account and start sharing right away!

I would also like to remind everyone that the DiGRA student community has an active [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/digrastudents), as well as a Twitter account ([@digrastudents](http://twitter.com/digrastudents)). Please join the page and/or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date on the latest news and events that may be of interest to students, academics, and professionals under the DiGRA umbrella.

This would also be a great time to remind your colleagues/students of our burgeoning community!
