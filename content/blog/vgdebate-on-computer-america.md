This week I joined the team at [Computer America](http://computeramerica.com/) (the longest running nationally syndicated radio show on computers and technology) to talk about ["The Video Game Debate: Unravelling the Physical, Social and Psychological Effects of Digital Games"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=rexmac-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=TPC3FPQLYQW5BBA6&creativeASIN=1138831638). 

Lucky for us, Computer America is not only broadcast on the radio but it is also streamed (with video) via their website! So, if you have been wondering what "The Video Game Debate..." is all about, be sure and check out [the archive of this week's show](http://computeramerica.com/2015/12/14/dr-rachel-kowert-news/)!
