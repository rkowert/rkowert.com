This week, I visited my local Fox news studio to talk about [A Parentâ€™s Guide...](https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Video-Games-understanding/dp/1537359835/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8), video games, and Christmas. A lot of parents are concerned about the amount of time their children playing games during the holiday season. How much is too much? Is it okay if our children spend all day playing their new video games? When can I tell if their playing is teetering on problematic or addicted play? For the answers to these questions (and more) you can [watch my interview with Fox 7, here](http://www.fox7austin.com/good-day/225305468-story).
