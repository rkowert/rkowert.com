**New Book Announcement: [The Video Game Debate: Unravelling the Physical, Social, and Psychological Effects of Digital Games](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=rexmac-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=TPC3FPQLYQW5BBA6&creativeASIN=1138831638)** (Kowert & Quandt, Eds).

[Prof. Thorsten Quandt](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Kowi/en/personen/thorsten-quandt.html) and I are proud to announce the release of The Video Game Debate: Unravelling the Physical, Social, and Psychological Effects of Digital Games.  Now, for the first time, you can catch up with the state of the research relating to digital game effects in an easy to read volume. “The Video Game Debate…” is a compilation of short review articles about the positive and negative effects of digital games written by some of the top international scholars of digital games studies – such as [Cheryl Olson](http://www.drcherylolson.com/), [Mark Griffiths](http://www.ntu.ac.uk/apps/staff_profiles/staff_directory/125054-0/26/mark_griffiths.aspx), and [Chris Ferguson](http://www.stetson.edu/other/faculty/profiles/christopher-ferguson.php). It addresses such questions as:

* Do violent video games cause aggression?
* Are online communities socially valuable?
* Can we learn from video games? If so, what? 

…and more ([you can see the full ToC here](http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/books/details/9781138831636/))!
 
Not only is this volume the _first_ to provide a comprehensive source of information on the potential effects of video game play (off- and online, positive and negative), but it is the first volume of its kind to be written with a general audience in mind. Our aim was to create a book that is equally assessable and valuable to parents, policy makers, educators, and clinicians as well as scholars.  
 
For the **parent** and the **gamer**, this volume provides information about what the researchers in the field have to say about the effects, both positive and negative, of digital game play.
 
For the **policy maker**, this volume gets you up to speed with the state of the research within the scientific community, allowing you to understand the strengths and limitations of this line of research as well as the current understanding of what, if any, effects are evident and how strong they are.
 
For the **clinician**, this volume helps you to better inform your clients, whether they be concerned parents or gamers themselves.
 
For the **scholar**, this volume provides a series of concise, essays relating to the primary concerns (i.e., debates) within game studies. Sure beats reading hundreds of articles! Although, of course, the volume is fully referenced so you will be able to find further resources if you are interested in learning more about a particular subject.
 
For the **educator**, this book helps you get a better understanding of this new medium in terms of its place in our culture and society, the moral panics surrounding it, and the state of effects research. The chapters on Games and Learning and Gaming Communities also help generate a better understanding of how games can be used in the classroom (these chapters are useful for **game designers** as well!).
 
As this book is organized as a series of short articles, it also makes a great text for media studies, game studies, and media effects courses (if you are interested in using this book for your courses, you should [request a review copy from Routledge](http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/books/details/9781138831636/)).

We hope that you will enjoy [“The Video Game Debate…”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=rexmac-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=TPC3FPQLYQW5BBA6&creativeASIN=1138831638) and that it will soon become a valuable resource within the community and beyond! 

If you do pick up a copy, it would be **greatly appreciated** if you could take a minute or two to [review it on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Video-Game-Debate-Psychological/dp/1138831638/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=rexmac-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=TPC3FPQLYQW5BBA6&creativeASIN=1138831638). It should take less than 5 minutes and it makes a HUGE difference in who sees, reads, and orders it. **Thank you!**
