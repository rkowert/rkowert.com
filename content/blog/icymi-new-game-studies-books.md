What a time to be someone who studies video games! When I started down this line of research (~2008) there were very few comprehensive resources in the field -- particularly books. Flash forward to today, and there are literally hundreds! However, lately I have noticed a particularly sharp increase in the quality of the books that are coming out in this area (and notably, many are being authored and/or edited by some of the best scholars studies books in the field)!

Here are just some of the ones I have been most excited about:

[Getting Gamers: The Psychology of Video Games and Their Impact on the People who Play Them](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Gamers-Psychology-Impact-People/dp/1442239999/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1493601301&sr=1-1&keywords=jamie+madigan) – Jamie Madigan
