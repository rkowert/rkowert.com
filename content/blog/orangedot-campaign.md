In an attempt to combat some of the bad press that games, gaming, and gamers have received over the last few months (#GamerGate anyone?), [_Good Games Writing_](http://www.goodgameswriting.com/) launched their [#OrangeDot Campaign](http://www.goodgameswriting.com/2014/11/orange-dot-campaign/) this month. The primary aim of this campaign was to help “take back this space we hold so dearly…” and spread positivity about games in various ways. As part of the #OrangeDot Campaign, several editorial features highlighting women in the games industry, including game developers, journalists, and researchers, were published via their website. I was one of the lucky few to be selected by _Good Games Writing_ and a short editorial essay on my work went live last week (you can check it out [here](http://www.goodgameswriting.com/2014/11/rachel-kowert/)).
