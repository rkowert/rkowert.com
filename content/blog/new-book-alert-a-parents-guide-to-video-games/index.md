My new book, [A Parent’s Guide to Video Games: The essential guide to understanding how video games impact your child’s physical, social, and psychological well-being](http://amzn.to/2glwaD8), was released this week!

Despite the fact that video games have been in our everyday lives for almost 40 years now, the world of video games remains a treacherous place for many parents. Always in the forefront of the press, the intersection of video games, violence and antisocial behavior worries many parents, but a lot of the studies released to the public give a very narrow glimpse into the effects of video games. My new book, [“A Parent’s Guide to Video Games,”](http://amzn.to/2glwaD8) sets out to provide moms and dads with a reliable resource of information and advice backed up by over 100 scientific studies on video games and the way they affect physical, social, and mental development among children.

[“A Parent’s Guide to Video Games”](http://amzn.to/2glwaD8) investigates the issues of video game addiction, worsening ADHD symptoms through extended game play and the correlation between agression and violent games. However, the book doesn’t just look into some of the potential negatives of game play but also investigates the positive ways that video games can impact children. This guide will help parents look at all the information the scientific community has gathered as they try to decide what games to choose for their children and whether they want their kids playing games at all. 

Intrigued? “A Parent’s Guide” is now [available for order on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2glwaD8) and will be available in Kindle format in the next few weeks.
